Try out the demo, which [is hosted live here!](https://raindrop-gold.vercel.app/)

## ðŸš€ **Statement**

**We are eager to continue the project after the hackathon in order to actually launch it in the world.**


## ðŸŽ¬ **Pitch & Live Demo (Video)**

Raindrop offers creators a decentralized alternative to platform subscriptions sites like Patreon or Onlyfans.

## ðŸ’¬ **Problem**

-   The tools creators use to engage with fans force them to be tied to certain platforms. Centralized membership platforms like Patreon and Onlyfans have too much power over content creators. Risks include:
    -   Legacy payment methods with little flexibility
    -   Being censored or de-platformed
    -   User data is not portable. Migrating content and fan base to different platforms is difficult.

## ðŸ’¡ **Solution**

-   **Build tools for creators to connect and engage with their fan base directly. We help creators access web3 technology to better connect with fans. Raindrop helps fans get direct and exclusive access to their favorite creators by leveraging web3 identity and payment technologies. Creators bypass the middleman and keep 100% ownership of their content.**

    -   **1. Data Portability**
        -   Creators content and fan base can be migrated to other platforms
    -   **2. Membership community made easy**
        -   Create communities at the touch of a button. Minimum knowledge of development is required to use Web3 technologies.
    -   **3. Real time and transparent data visualization**
        -   Visualization of on-chain data to help creators understand their communities.

## ðŸ’» **How We Build on**

### Technological Implementation

#### Tech Stack

-   Front-End: React, Typescript, Rainbowkit/Wagmi, 
-   Back-End: Ceramic, IPFS, Livepeer
-   Contracts: Unlock Protocol
-   Blockchain: We are deployed on Polygon and Optimism


#### Data Portability

-   **Ceramic**ï¼š We are mixing these on-chain solutions with off-chain portable data by using Ceramic and Lit protocols, to achieve a superior UX combined with NextJS to easily onboard every kind of use in any platform.
-   **IPFS/Filecoin**ï¼š To allow creators to do closed content with images on the decentralized networks. Also, to allow uploading of profile images on it.
-   **Livepeer**ï¼š To allow creators to do closed content with movies on the decentralized networks.  

#### Membership community made easy

-   **Unlock**ï¼š Subscription framework, using NFT as a proof of subscription to unlock exclusive creator streams.
-   **Polygon**ï¼šTo deploy SBTs to the blockchain for low gas prices to prove that a user has met a person because of low transaction cost and privacy by using ZK.
-   **Optimism**ï¼š For creators to deploy membership NFT because of scalability.
-   **The Graph**: To track Unlock smart contract deployments and NFTs (keys) owners to use quickly on the frontend. This makes Raindrop a multi-chain application and the subgraph really helps us to do that with good UI/UX experience for not only users, but also developers in our team.
-   **EPNS**ï¼š It is used as a notification function for creator contentâ€™s update for fans.
-   **Tellor**ï¼š - Tellorï¼šAllowing creator to conduct giveaways for their subscriber by using Tellor RNG to generate a random number for us which can be used to select the winner. 



#### Real time and transparent data visualization

-   **Worldcoin**ï¼š To prove that creators and fans is real human.
-   **ENS**ï¼š It is used as one of the creator's profile information to increase their credibility.
-   **Sismo**ï¼š To increase trust and understand about users well by aggregating on-chain data visible while protecting user privacy information.

### Detailed Demo of the use of sponsor technology

## âœ¨ **Potential Impact**

#### â‘  It will be a direct relationship between creators and fans.

-   No platform to determine what content will or will not be allowed, no opaque algorithm to determine what content will rise or fall, and no inter-party payment platform that can withhold payments from creators based on arbitrary policy changes will accelerate the creator economy by coming into existence.

#### â‘¡ Creators will be able to focus more on their creative activities.

-   With traditional subscriptions, Twitch determines the subscription price and revenue sharing. If Twitch decides to cut back on compensation to creators, there is no easy way to move your community to another platform. With an Subscription NF, the NFT with the community is yours. No platform dictates how you interact with your fans.

#### â‘¢ A great alternative to existing web2 platforms!

Having a well designed app/front-end giving creators the ability to token gate their premium content for it to be consume only by the fans financially supporting their work seems like a great alternative to existing web2 platforms!


## ðŸ““ **Appendix**

### Our Product Roadmap

~~#### â‘  Enhance the UX of creators' contents by making them compatible with a variety of content formats, including text, video, photos, and audio.~~

How creative and unique:

-   Having a well designed app/front-end giving creators the ability to token gate their premium a variety of decentralized contents by Livepeer, IPFS etc for it to be consume only by the fans financially supporting their work seems like a great alternative to existing web2 platforms!

#### â‘¡ Adding a variety of utilities to the Subscription NFT will support a steady income for creators.

How creative and unique

-   There are numerous mechanics to align incentives for collectors and service providers like Scarce, Tiered Time-limited, Revokable, Refundable, Resettable, Locked up, Burned, Staked, Soulbound, Price-controlled Held custody of. However, there is still no platform that makes these easy for anyone to use.

#### â‘¢ Launch on Mobile App like iOS and Android

How creative and unique:

-   To make Web3Social's products a product market fit for consumers, it is necessary to achieve a better UX, and a mobile experience is essential to this. There are only a few projects in the industry that are able to combine data portability and mobile.
